## Installation
Download all the files into a folder and then run index.html

You can add custom animated titles by naming your GIFs the same as the tiles and putting them in the same folder as index.html. For example: 2.gif, 4.gif, 8.gif, etc

You can also add sound effects by naming the WAV the same as the tile number you want to trigger the sound. For example, if you want a sound to play with two 4 blocks combine, name it 8.wav since it will be an 8 block that is created.
